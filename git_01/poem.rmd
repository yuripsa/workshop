## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!  
How I wonder what you're at!  
Up above the world you fly,  
Like a tea tray in the sky.  
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!  
 

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Nature's first green is gold,  
Her hardest hue to hold.  
Her early leaf's a flower;  
But only so an hour.  
Then leaf subsides to leaf,  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
Hold so fast to dreams  
For if dreams die  
Life is a broken-winged bird  
That cannot fly.  
 
Hold fast to dreams  
For when dreams go  
Life is a barren field  
Frozen with snow.
